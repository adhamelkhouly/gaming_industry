## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Anaconda3 installation is needed (or equivalent libraries), as well as Python 3.X.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is my first Data Science project, and also happens to be the first project in Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree.

1. Business Understanding
  - What are the main factors affecting a game's score?
  - Are certain game genres more likely to be scored higher?
  - Do game release dates affect how a game is received?
  - Do certain platforms have generally higher scores?
  - Which games tend to succeed on certain consoles?
 
2. Data Understanding
  - I attempt to answer the mentioned questions using data gathered from ign.com. The data contains ame release dates, genres, platforms,   and scores.

3. Prepare Data
  - Data prepartion is done in the Jupyter notebook.

4. Model Data
  - Modelling is also done in the Jupyter notebook.

5. Results and Deployment
  - Results and diagrams are shown in the Jupyter notebook. A blog [post](https://medium.com/@adham.elkh/are-some-games-already-set-to-succeed-2be98dcb6db3) was also created to communicate all the findings.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

- ign.csv : contains game release dates, genres, platforms, and scores.
- Are_Some_Games_Set_To_Succeed.ipynb : This notebook contains all the data analysis and modelling.


## Results<a name="results"></a>

Main results were used to create a Medium post that can be found [here](https://medium.com/@adham.elkh/are-some-games-already-set-to-succeed-2be98dcb6db3).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>
Credit to the Udacity lectures for some of the coding and visualization ideas. As well as, to Kaggle for providing the dataset.
